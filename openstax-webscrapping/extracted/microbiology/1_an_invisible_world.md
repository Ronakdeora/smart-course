![Figure a is a map of a city containing a stadium, forum, and other structures. Running through the center of the city is a red line. Figure b is a photograph of a corner of a room. There is a trough between the walls and the floor. This trough is covered with stone benches that have large holes (as for a toilet) in the bench. The holes span the top and front of the bench. There are six holes visible in the bench that runs along one side of the image and two more in the bench along the other side. The image does not show the entire room so there are likely more available spots in this room.](https://openstax.org/apps/image-cdn/v1/f=webp/apps/archive/20250827.171612/resources/88592c501269473a2a44ec84c3bcd3e93f6fa4e8)

![Figure a is a photograph of a round disk streaked with lines. The thickest lines go back and forth along an area spanning one fifth of the plate. The next fifth of the plate also has thick lines. The next fifth of the plate has thinner lines that are made of tiny dots. The final fifth of the pate only has large dots. Figure b shows a hand holding a metal rod that is the diameter of a pretzel stick; projecting from tis is a thick wire that is formed into a loop at the end.](https://openstax.org/apps/image-cdn/v1/f=webp/apps/archive/20250827.171612/resources/4d8ae09285ddae4a6dedf474999e0c01af9c25d6)

![A bar along the bottom indicates size of various objects. At the far right is a from egg at approximately 1 mm. To the left are a human egg and a pollen grain at approximately 0.1 mm. Next are a standard plant and animal cell which range from 10 – 100 µm. Next is a red blood cell at just under 10 µm. Next are a mitochondrion and bacterial cell at approximately 1 µm. Next is a smallpox virus at approximately 500 nm. Next is a flu virus at approximately 100 nm. Next is a polio virus at approximately 50 nm. Next are proteins which range from 5-10 nm. Next are lipids which range from 2-5 nm. Next is C60 (fullerene molecule) which is approximately 1 nm. Finally, atoms are approximately 0.1 nm. Light microscopes can be used to view items larger than 100 nm (the size of a flu virus). Electron microscopes are useful for materials from 1.5 nm (larger than an atom) to 1 µm (the size of many bacteria).](https://openstax.org/apps/image-cdn/v1/f=webp/apps/archive/20250827.171612/resources/ccb2d41136898806a7dd14ca9743309fe9f1bc71)
