![Figure a shows a wavy line with evenly repeating waves upwards and downwards. A straight line through the center of the wavy line indicates the base of the waves. The distance from the peak of one wave to another is the wavelength. The distance from the baseline to the peak of a wave or the distance from the baseline to the trough of a wave is called the amplitude. Figure b shows three waves with unit time labeled across the bottom. The top line has waves that are widely spread apart. Waves with a wide wavelength have a low frequency. The bottom line has waves that are close together. Waves with a narrow wavelength have a high frequency. The middle line has a medium wavelength and therefore a medium frequency.](https://openstax.org/apps/image-cdn/v1/f=webp/apps/archive/20250827.171612/resources/9331089a4ae3d618466077b8989ffd0b951135df)

![Picture a shows a light beam aimed at a piece of glass. When the light beam hits the transparent glass material it bends by approximately 45°. This bent light ray is the refracted ray. The opaque material which the glass is sitting upon does not have any light shining through it. Diagram b shows an arrow labeled incident ray pointing at a 45° angle down towards a shaded region. At the point where the incident ray reaches the shaded region, two other arrows begin. One of these arrows points at a 90° angle from the incident ray (and away from the shaded region) and is the reflected ray. The second arrow continues through the shaded region but at a slightly bent angle from the incident ray. This second arrow is the reflected ray.](https://openstax.org/apps/image-cdn/v1/f=webp/apps/archive/20250827.171612/resources/8944fd6e8a4e08035023b4a031242c564b31f938)

![Diagram a (prism) shows a clear pyramid with light entering one surface. The light leaving the other surface is bent and is the refracted light. A dotted line indicates the path the original light beam would have taken had it not bent. The region above the dotted line is labeled high refractive index; the region below the line is labeled low refractive index. Diagram b (convex lens) shows a lens with a bulge in the center. Light enters one either side of the dome and is focused to a point past the lens and in line with the center of the dome. The point at which the light focuses is the focal point; the distance from the focal point to the center of the lens is the focal length. Diagram c (concave lens) shows a lens that curves inward on either side. Light entering this lens is bent outwards, away from the center of the lens’s curve. A dotted line shows the linear path backwards for each of the bent light beams. The point at which all the dotted lines meet (which is on the other side of the lens) is the focal point.](https://openstax.org/apps/image-cdn/v1/f=webp/apps/archive/20250827.171612/resources/bcaeebc796092b5a677bc07df336f554919c9246)

![The stages of a biofilm are shown. In stage 1 (initial attachment), a few flagellated cells attach to a surface. In stage 2 (irreversible attachment) clumps of cells are found on the surface. In stage 3 (maturation) the clumps have enlarged. In stage 4 (maturation 2) the clumps have fused and enlarged greatly. In stage 5 (dispersal) the large clump releases flagellated cells away from the surface. These stages are also shown in micrographs: 1) small dots, 2) larger clumps, 3)larger clump, 4) a large mass, 5) a large mass with an opening at the top.](https://openstax.org/apps/image-cdn/v1/f=webp/apps/archive/20250827.171612/resources/40b1ace8e14bbb44d51cf195fc965d59fbd450f8)

![A table of light microscope types. These use visible or ultraviolet light to produce an image. Magnification: up to about 1000x. Brightfield microscopes are commonly used in a wide variety of laboratory applications as the standard microscope and produce an image on a bright background. The sample image of Bacillus sp. shows red rods on a clear background; small green dots in the red cells indicate endospores. Darkfield microscopes increase contrast without staining by producing a bright image on a dark background. These are especially useful for viewing live specimens. The sample image (Borrelia burgdorferi) shows bright spirals on a dark background. Phase contrast microscopes use refraction and interference caused by structures in the specimen to create high-contrast, high-resolution images without staining, making it useful for viewing live specimens and structures such as endospores and organelles. The sample image (Pseudomonas sp.) shows dark rods with a bright halo. Differential interference contrast (DIC) uses interference patters to enhance contrast between different features of a specimen to produce high-contrast images of living organisms with a three-dimensional appearance, making it especially useful in distinguishing structures within live, unstained specimens. Images viewed reveal detailed structures within cells. The sample image (Escherichia coli 0157:H7) shows small three-dimensional ovals. Fluorescence uses fluorescent stains to produce an image. Fluorescent microscopes can be used to identify pathogens, to find particular species, to distinguish living from dead, or to find location of particular molecules within a cell; also used for immunofluorescence. The sample image (Pseuodomonas putida stained with fluorescent dyes to visualize capsule) shows a green rod on a black background. Confocal microscopes use a laser to scan multiple z-planes successively, producing numerous two-dimensional, high-resolution images at various depths that can be constructed into a three-dimensional image by a computer, making this useful for examining thick specimens such as biofilms. The sample image (mouse intestine cells stained with fluorescent dye) shows cells of various colors on a dark background.](https://openstax.org/apps/image-cdn/v1/f=webp/apps/archive/20250827.171612/resources/3c135d5d8b6adc47319e592240596491ee73ff77)

Transmission electron microscopes (TEM) use electron means that pass through a specimen to visual small images; useful to observe small, thin specimens such as tissue sections and subcellular structures. The sample image (Ebola virus) shows a tube shaped into a letter d at one end. Scanning electron microscopes (SEM) use electron beams to visualize surfaces; useful to observe the three-dimensional surface details of specimens. The sample image (Campylobactor jejuni) shows thick three-dimensional spirals.](https://openstax.org/apps/image-cdn/v1/f=webp/apps/archive/20250827.171612/resources/c3a96a37ffdd7389929163ccb354cb0e339fb4b0)

![A table of scanning probe microscopes with very sharp probes that are passed over the surface of the specimen and interact with it directly. Magnification: 100–100,000,000x or more. A scanning tunneling microscope (STM) uses a probe passed horizontally at a constant distance just above the specimen while the intensity of the current is measured; can map the structure of surfaces at the atomic level; works best on conducting materials but can also be used to examine organic materials such as DNA if fixed on a surface. The sample image (of a gold surface) shows small circles in repeating rows. Atomic force microscopes (AFM) are used in several ways, including using a laser focused on a cantilever to measure the bending of the tip or a probe passed above the specimen while the height needs to maintain a constant current is measured; useful to observe specimens at the atomic level and can be more easily used with nonconducting samples. The sample image (carboxymethylated nanocellulse absorbed on a silica surface) shows long strands throughout.](https://openstax.org/apps/image-cdn/v1/f=webp/apps/archive/20250827.171612/resources/1b08f60f57ae95abd45a11f39650ba046a6e9d7c)

![A table shows the Gram stain process. Each row consists of a column describing the step and a column describing the effect. Additional columns show drawings to support the description in the effects column. Step 1: Crystal Violet, the primary stain, is added to the specimen smear. This stains cells purple or blue. The Gram-positive and Gram-negative cells all look purple. Step 2: Iodine, the mordant, makes the dye less soluble so it adheres to cell walls. The cells remain purple or blue. The Gram-positive and Gram-negative cells all look purple. Step 3: Alcohol, the decolorizer, washes away stain from Gram-negative cell walls. Gram-positive cells remain purple or blue, Gram-negative cells are colorless. Step 4: Safranin, the counterstain, allows dye adherence to Gram-negative cells. Gram-positive cells remain a pruple or blue. Gram-negative cells appear pink or red.](https://openstax.org/apps/image-cdn/v1/f=webp/apps/archive/20250827.171612/resources/618c08bd594aa6626811825a8fa7ea3b7c1e784a)

![A table of differential stains is shown. The Gram stain uses crystal violet, Gram’s iodine, ethanol (decolorizer), and safranin. The purpose of the Gram stain is to distinguish cells by cell-wall type (Gram-positive, Gram-negative). Gram-positive cells stain purple/violet. Gram-negative cells stain pink. The acid fast stain: after staining with basic fuchsin, acid-fast bacteria resist decolonization by acid-alcohol. Non-acid-fast bacteria are counterstained with methylene blue. The acid-fast stain is used to distinguish acid-fast bacteria such as M. tuberculosis, from non-acid-fast cells. Acid-fast bacteria are red; non-acid-fast cells are blue. The Endospore stain uses heat to stain endospores with malachite green (Schaeffer-Fulton procedure), then cell is washed and counterstained with safranin. The endospore stain is used to distinguish organisms with endospores from those without; used to study the endospore. Endospores appear bluish-green; other structures appear pink to red. Flagella stain: flagella are coated with a tannic acid or potassium alum mordant, then stained using either pararosaline or basic fuchsin. The flagella stain is used to view and study flagella in bacteria that have them. Flagella are visible as thin strands if present. Capsule stain: negative staining with india ink or nigrosine is used to stain the background, leaving a clear area of the cell and the capsule Counterstaining can be used to stain the cell while leaving the capsule clear. The capsule stain is used to distinguish cells with capsules from those without. Capsules appear clear or as halos if present.](https://openstax.org/apps/image-cdn/v1/f=webp/apps/archive/20250827.171612/resources/7b359372004f7ff3577bff266ad1015eb944b8df)
