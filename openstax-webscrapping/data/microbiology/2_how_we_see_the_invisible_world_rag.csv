2.1_content_7,text,"Visible light consists of electromagnetic waves that behave like other waves. Hence, many of the properties of light that are relevant to microscopy can be understood in terms of light’s behavior as a wave. An important property of light waves is the wavelength, or the distance between one peak of a wave and the next peak. The height of each peak (or depth of each trough) is called the amplitude. In contrast, the frequency of the wave is the rate of vibration of the wave, or the number of wavelengths within a specified time period (Figure 2.2).",2.1 The Properties of Light,[],"['Identify and define the characteristics of electromagnetic radiation (EMR) used in microscopy', 'Explain how lenses are used in microscopy to manipulate visible and ultraviolet (UV) light']","{'chapter': 'How We See the Invisible World', 'section_id': '2.1', 'chunk_type': 'content_paragraph'}",,

2.1_content_9,text,"Light waves interact with materials by being reflected, absorbed, or transmitted. Reflection occurs when a wave bounces off of a material. For example, a red piece of cloth may reflect red light to our eyes while absorbing other colors of light. Absorbance occurs when a material captures the energy of a light wave. In the case of glow-in-the-dark plastics, the energy from light can be absorbed and then later re-emitted as another form of phosphorescence. Transmission occurs when a wave travels through a material, like light through glass (the process of transmission is called transmittance). When a material allows a large proportion of light to be transmitted, it may do so because it is thinner, or more transparent (having more transparency and less opacity).

A convex lens can be used to magnify because it can focus at closer range than the human eye, producing a larger image. Concave lenses and mirrors can also be used in microscopes to redirect the light path.

When the retina receives visible light of many different frequencies, we perceive this as white light. However, white light can be separated into its component colors using refraction. If we pass white light through a prism, different colors will be refracted in different directions, creating a rainbow-like spectrum on a screen behind the prism. This separation of colors is called dispersion, and it occurs because, for a given material, the refractive index is different for different frequencies of light.",2.1 The Properties of Light,[],"['Identify and define the characteristics of electromagnetic radiation (EMR) used in microscopy', 'Explain how lenses are used in microscopy to manipulate visible and ultraviolet (UV) light']","{'chapter': 'How We See the Invisible World', 'section_id': '2.1', 'chunk_type': 'content_paragraph'}",,
2.1_content_26,text,"Certain materials can refract nonvisible forms of EMR and, in effect, transform them into visible light. Certain fluorescent dyes, for instance, absorb ultraviolet or blue light and then use the energy to emit photons of a different color, giving off light rather than simply vibrating. This occurs because the energy absorption causes electrons to jump to higher energy states, after which they then almost immediately fall back down to their ground states, emitting specific amounts of energy as photons. Not all of the energy is emitted in a given photon, so the emitted photons will be of lower energy and, thus, of lower frequency than the absorbed ones. Thus, a dye such as Texas red may be excited by blue light, but emit red light; or a dye such as fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) may absorb (invisible) high-energy ultraviolet light and emit green light (Figure 2.8). In some materials, the photons may be emitted following a delay after absorption; in this case, the process is called phosphorescence.

Shorter wavelengths are able to resolve smaller objects; thus, an electron microscope has a much higher resolution than a light microscope, since it uses an electron beam with a very short wavelength, as opposed to the long-wavelength visible light used by a light microscope.

In 1830, Joseph Jackson Lister created an essentially modern light microscope. The 20th century saw the development of microscopes that leveraged nonvisible light, such as fluorescence microscopy, which uses an ultraviolet light source, and electron microscopy, which uses short-wavelength electron beams. These advances led to major improvements in magnification, resolution, and contrast. By comparison, the relatively rudimentary microscopes of van Leeuwenhoek and his contemporaries were far less powerful than even the most basic microscopes in use today.

The magnification of these objective lenses typically ranges from 4⨯ to 100⨯, with the magnification for each lens designated on the metal casing of the lens.

Light from the illuminator passes up through condenser lens (located below the stage), which focuses all of the light rays on the specimen to maximize illumination. The position of the condenser can be optimized using the attached condenser focus knob; once the optimal distance is established, the condenser should not be moved to adjust the brightness. If less-than-maximal light levels are needed, the amount of light striking the specimen can be easily adjusted by opening or closing a diaphragm between the condenser and the specimen.

2.3_content_32,text,"Phase-contrast microscopes use refraction and interference caused by structures in a specimen to create high-contrast, high-resolution images without staining. It is the oldest and simplest type of microscope that creates an image by altering the wavelengths of light rays passing through the specimen. To create altered wavelength paths, an annular stop is used in the condenser. The annular stop produces a hollow cone of light that is focused on the specimen before reaching the objective lens. The objective contains a phase plate containing a phase ring. As a result, light traveling directly from the illuminator passes through the phase ring while light refracted or reflected by the specimen passes through the plate. This causes waves traveling through the ring to be about one-half of a wavelength out of phase with those passing through the plate. Because waves have peaks and troughs, they can add together (if in phase together) or cancel each other out (if out of phase). When the wavelengths are out of phase, wave troughs will cancel out wave peaks, which is called destructive interference. Structures that refract light then appear dark against a bright background of only unrefracted light. More generally, structures that differ in features such as refractive index will differ in levels of darkness (Figure 2.16).",2.3 Instruments of Microscopy,['gene'],"['Identify and describe the parts of a brightfield microscope', 'Calculate total magnification for a compound microscope', 'Describe the distinguishing features and typical uses for various types of light microscopes, electron microscopes, and scanning probe microscopes']","{'chapter': 'How We See the Invisible World', 'section_id': '2.3', 'chunk_type': 'content_paragraph'}",,

Once the beams pass through either the specimen or specimen-free space, they are recombined and effects of the specimens cause differences in the interference patterns generated by the combining of the beams.

2.3_content_51,text,"While the original fluorescent and confocal microscopes allowed better visualization of unique features in specimens, there were still problems that prevented optimum visualization. The effective sensitivity of fluorescence microscopy when viewing thick specimens was generally limited by out-of-focus flare, which resulted in poor resolution. This limitation was greatly reduced in the confocal microscope through the use of a confocal pinhole to reject out-of-focus background fluorescence with thin (<1 μm), unblurred optical sections. However, even the confocal microscopes lacked the resolution needed for viewing thick tissue samples. These problems were resolved with the development of the two-photon microscope, which uses a scanning technique, fluorochromes, and long-wavelength light (such as infrared) to visualize specimens.

Brightfield microscopes are commonly used in a wide variety of laboratory applications as the standard microscope and produce an image on a bright background. The sample image of Bacillus sp. shows red rods on a clear background; small green dots in the red cells indicate endospores. Darkfield microscopes increase contrast without staining by producing a bright image on a dark background. These are especially useful for viewing live specimens. The sample image (Borrelia burgdorferi) shows bright spirals on a dark background. Phase contrast microscopes use refraction and interference caused by structures in the specimen to create high-contrast, high-resolution images without staining, making it useful for viewing live specimens and structures such as endospores and organelles. The sample image (Pseudomonas sp.) shows dark rods with a bright halo. Differential interference contrast (DIC) uses interference patters to enhance contrast between different features of a specimen to produce high-contrast images of living organisms with a three-dimensional appearance, making it especially useful in distinguishing structures within live, unstained specimens. Images viewed reveal detailed structures within cells. The sample image (Escherichia coli 0157:H7) shows small three-dimensional ovals. Fluorescence uses fluorescent stains to produce an image. Fluorescent microscopes can be used to identify pathogens, to find particular species, to distinguish living from dead, or to find location of particular molecules within a cell; also used for immunofluorescence. The sample image (Pseuodomonas putida stained with fluorescent dyes to visualize capsule) shows a green rod on a black background. Confocal microscopes use a laser to scan multiple z-planes successively, producing numerous two-dimensional, high-resolution images at various depths that can be constructed into a three-dimensional image by a computer, making this useful for examining thick specimens such as biofilms.

First, older bacterial cells may have damage to their cell walls that causes them to appear gram-negative even if the species is gram-positive. Thus, it is best to use fresh bacterial cultures for Gram staining. Second, errors such as leaving the decolorizer on for too long can affect the results. For example, if the decolorizer is left on a slide of pure gram-positive bacterial cells for too long, some of the gram-positive cells will be decolorized and stained red with safranin, suggesting a mixed culture.

First, older bacterial cells may have damage to their cell walls that causes them to appear gram-negative even if the species is gram-positive. Thus, it is best to use fresh bacterial cultures for Gram staining. Second, errors such as leaving the decolorizer on for too long can affect the results. For example, if the decolorizer is left on a slide of pure gram-positive bacterial cells for too long, some of the gram-positive cells will be decolorized and stained red with safranin, suggesting a mixed culture.

To cut cells without damage, the cells must be embedded in plastic resin and then dehydrated through a series of soaks in ethanol solutions (50%, 60%, 70%, and so on). The ethanol replaces the water in the cells, and the resin dissolves in ethanol and enters the cell, where it solidifies. Next, thin sections are cut using a specialized device called an ultramicrotome (Figure 2.42). Finally, samples are fixed to fine copper wire or carbon-fiber grids and stained—not with colored dyes, but with substances like uranyl acetate or osmium tetroxide, which contain electron-dense heavy metal atoms.",2.4 Staining Microscopic Specimens,['cell'],"['Differentiate between simple and differential stains', 'Describe the unique features of commonly used stains', 'Explain the procedures and name clinical applications for Gram, endospore, acid-fast, negative capsule, and flagella staining']","{'chapter': 'How We See the Invisible World', 'section_id': '2.4', 'chunk_type': 'content_paragraph'}",,

Additionally, this species has not been successfully cultured in the laboratory on an artificial medium; therefore, diagnosis depends upon successful identification using microscopic techniques and serology (analysis of body fluids, often looking for antibodies to a pathogen). Since fixation and staining would kill the cells, darkfield microscopy is typically used for observing live specimens and viewing their movements. However, other approaches can also be used. For example, the cells can be thickened with silver particles (in tissue sections) and observed using a light microscope.
